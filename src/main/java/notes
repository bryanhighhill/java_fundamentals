METHODS

public static int calculateSum( int number1, int number2) {

    int sum = number1 + number2;
    return sum;
}

    - declaration of method is called "Method Header"
    - public, protected, private: access modifier - who has access to method outside of class
        + public: anyone can access anywhere
    - static, final, abstract, synchronized: non-access modifier
    - int: return type. all methods must specify return type. if not returning anything, specify return type of void
    - calculateSum: name of method - typically in form of verb, with exception of returning boolean
    - int number1, int number2: parameter list. required even if no parameters. data that must be sent to method
    - method signature: name of method + parameter list (data type and order)
    - last line of method body must return value declared unless VOID


Overloaded methods
    - a class can have multiple methods with same name, but they must have unique parameter list

Variable Scope
    - variable is only accessible within scope that it is declared in

Local Variable Type Inference
    - when declaring a local variable, you can use var
    instead of boolean isWaterWet = true you could type var isWaterWet = true.
    - Must be a local variable - not global, and must be assigning applicable value

Objects
    - structures that contain data in the form of fields and methods
    - classes used to define makeup of object

Encapsulation
    - all data and behavior is contained within the object itself
    - expose behavior and restrict direct access to data

Constructors
    - structures within a class that are used to set the initial state of an object
